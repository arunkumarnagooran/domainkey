    <p style="font-size: 160%;">
        Passive information gathering involves collecting data about a target system, network, or organization without directly interacting with it.    This approach aims to gather information from publicly available sources, without raising any alarms or leaving traces.<br> 
      To accomplish this task, you will use the web, along with some automated tools
        that call the web at the backend as well. This phase is also called the
        collection of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). OSINT refers to the
        information collected from the internet.
        <br>
    Sometimes, when organizations advertise a vacancy on a job
    recruiting website, the recruiter posts technical requirements for the potential candidate.
    From a penetration tester's point of view, the technical details can indicate the types of
    platforms, operating systems, network device vendors, and applications that are running
    within the organization's network infrastructure.
    <br>

    Always ensure that you are conducting your penetration testing activities within authorized boundaries and with proper permission from the target organization.
